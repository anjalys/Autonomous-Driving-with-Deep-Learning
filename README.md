# Autonomous-Driving-with-Deep-Learning
This project explores three deep learning-based models for predicting future waypoints in a simulated autonomous driving environment SuperTuxKart, a racing simulator. Models were trained to output 3 future waypoints in the vehicle's ego-centric coordinate frame using either structured lane boundary inputs or raw RGB images.
